## Appendix B: Supplement for Chapter 3 - In sickness and in health: RNA-Seq finds viruses associated with mutualist quality in the Amazonian plant-ant Allomerus octoarticulatus
List of tables: 

1. Table B2. RNA-Seq sequence number, sequence length, GC content, and quality scores before and after trimming.
2. Table B4. Differential transcript usage (DTU) analysis.
3. Table B5. Annotation of genes differentially expressed (DEG) in both activity and caste analyses. 
4. Table B6. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing high- and low-activity ant bodyguards.
5. Table B9. RdRp sequences used for phylogenetic analysis for Picornavirales.
6. Table B10. RdRp sequences used for phylogenetic analysis of Narna-like viruses.
7. Table B11. Amino acid sequence similarity in Picornavirales
8. Table B12. Amino acid sequence similarity in Narna-like viruses
9. Table B13. Analysis and annotation of genes differentially expressed between high-quality ant bodyguards and broodcare workers.
10. Table B14. Analysis and annotation of genes differentially expressed between low-quality ant bodyguards and broodcare workers.
11. Table B15. Differentially expressed genes and genes with differential transcript usage across comparisons. “HvsL” indicates the high- vs. low activity bodyguard comparison. “BvsL” indicates the low-activity bodyguard vs. broodcare worker comparison. “BvsH” indicates the high-activity bodyguard vs. broodcare worker comparison.
